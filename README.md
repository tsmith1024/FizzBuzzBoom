#  FizzBuzzBoom Challenge

## About the App
This app is a game that tests the math skills of users by asking them to determine if a number (displayed at the top of the screen) is divisible evenly by 3, by 5, by both, or by none. When a user taps an option in the app, the app checks the results and adds a result to the end of the results list at the bottom of the screen.

## Intro
This challenge has two parts -- debugging, and feature updates. Inside the project, you'll find multiple bugs that you must fix in order for the app to work properly. Work through each one step by step to make Once you've got the app working as expected, there are several updates to make to improve the app for users. Good luck!

## Challenges

### Bug Hunting
- The app currently won't compile and run. Fix all compile-time bugs and get the app running in the simulator.
- When the app launches, no value is being set in top label. Add the needed code to get the app to pick a number when the view loads.
- We're getting reports from users that the app crashes when selecting one of the buttons. Investigate that and fix the bug.
- We're also getting reports of incorrect results. Look into that and fix any errors that you find.

### Feature Updates
- Users are confused by the results, as the most recent result gets added to the bottom of the tableview, and not the top. Update the code so that the results are added to the top of the list.
- Users want a bigger challenge in the game. Update the code so it uses values from 1 - 1000, not 1 - 100
